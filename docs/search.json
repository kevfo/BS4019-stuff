    "text": "1.1 The Immune System\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Organs of the Human Immune System\n\n\n\n\nThe human body has numerous tissues and organs that are included in its immune system (i.e., a system that helps fend off pathogens):\n\nAdenoids\nThis is the first level of protection against pathogens in the nose.\nLymph Nodes\nThese enable B and T-cell activations\nBone Marrow\nThis is the site where blood is produced (i.e., haematopoiesis). B-cells also develop here via bone marrow-derived lymphocytes.\nTonsils\nThis is the first level of protection against pathogens in the mouth.\nThymus\nThis organ helps T-cells to mature.\nSpleen\nThis acts as a reserve of red blood cells (and also helps filter them). Microbes, opsonized pathogens, and aged or dead red blood cells are also filtered out here.\nB and T-cell activation also happens here.\nLymph Vessels\nImmune cells are circulated around the body via these.\n\n\n1.1.1 Innate and Adaptive Immunity\nThe innate immune system enables “non-self” antigens (e.g., pathogens) to be quickly eliminated. Cells in this system present antigens to activate T-cells (hence supporting antibody response).\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of Infection\n\n\n\n\nThe adaptive immune system has a slow response time (i.e., after the dashed vertical line above) and improves over time. Only via “memory” does this system quickly respond to known antigens.\n\n\n1.1.2 Main Cells of the Immune System\n\n\n\n\n\nCells of the Immune System\n\n\n\n\nThe immune system has many cells, of which include:\n\nMacrophages\nThese belong to the innate immune system and perform phagocytosis.\nThese are antigen-presenting cells.\nDendritic Cells\nThese also belong to the innate immune system and also play a role in phagocytosis, proteolysis, and the presentation of antigens.\nThese cells also play a role in T-cell activation.\nNatural Killer Cells\nThese belong to the innate immune system. They kill infected or cancer cells.\nT-Cells\nThese belong to the adaptive immune system; they are also specialized in recognizing non-self antigens via T-cell receptors.\nThere are numerous T-cells with different functions.\nB-Cells and Plasma Cells\nThese are part of the adaptive immune system and play a role in the production of antibodies.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 T-Cell Differentiation\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible T-Cells from Differentiation\n\n\n\n\nT-cells can differentiate into one of four kinds of T-cells:\n\nCD8+ “Cytotoxic” T-Cells\nThese kill cells that display a non-self antigen (e.g., an infected / tumor cell).\nCD4+ “Helper” T-Cells\nThese help activate CD8+ T-Cells and also B-Cells.\nCD4+ Regulatory Cells (Treg)\nThese help down-regulate the immune response.\nMemory T-Cells\nA small portion of T-cells go onto become involved in long-term immune responses.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 B-Cell Differentiation\n\n\n\n\n\nB-Cell Differentiation in the Human Immune System\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, B-cells can also go onto mature into one of several different kinds of B-cells:\n\nNaive B-Cells\nThese are B-cells that display antibodies against different kind of antigens’ surfaces (with about 107 to 108 different kinds of specific surfaces).\nActivated B-Cells\nThis happens when a naive B-cell binds to a specific antigen. This antigen (see above picture) is then displayed on its surface to help recruit CD4+ T-cells.\nPlasma B-Cells\nThese are antibody-producing cells.\nIgM - antibodies with a weak affinity and specificity - are produced and secreted. IgG - antibodies with a higher affinity and specificity - are generated in the long run.\nMemory B-Cells\nThese are involved in the long-term immune response to previously-encountered antigens.\n\nIgG-secreting antibodies can also be selected for further differentiation to produce higher-affinity IgGs via a maturation process."

    "text": "1.2 Immune System Responses\n\n\n\n\n\nStructures Involved in Innate and Adaptive Immunity\n\n\n\n\nThe human body’s innate immune system relies on patterns that are associated with pathogens and cell damage.\nThe adaptive immune system relies on specialized molecules with high specificities: T-cell receptors (i.e, TCRs) and antibodies.\n\n1.2.1 Antigen-Recognizing Molecules of the Immune System\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Antigen-Recognizing Molecules\n\n\n\n\nBS4019 covers a few:\n\nMHC molecules\nThese molecules shows linear peptides on antigen-presenting, infected, or cancerous cells.\nT-Cell Receptors\nThese are receptors that are displayed by T-cells.\nThese receptors also help recognize linear peptides that are shown by MHC molecules.\nImmunoglobins (i.e., Ig / antibodies)\nThese are secreted by \\(\\beta\\)-cells. Immunoglobins also recognize epitopes of various natures (e.g., proteins, lipids, sugars, etc).\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Phases of the Adaptive Immune System\n\n\n\n\n\nActivation of the Adaptive Immune System\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure goes in the following order:\n\nAntigen Recognition\nAntigen-presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells) show an antigen that is recognized by a naive T cell and / or a naive B-cell recognizes an antigen via an antibody on its surface.\nLymphocyte Activation\nThe specific T-cell is activated and undergoes clonal expansion. The T-cell then differentiates into effector T-cells.\nThe specific B-cell becomes activated, undergoes clonal expansion, and differentiates into antibody-producing cells.\nAntigen Elimination\nCytotoxic T-cells help eliminate infected cells.\nAntibodies also block pathogens and recruit innate immune cells (e.g., NK cells) to eliminate pathogens.\nContraction\nAfter pathogens are eliminated, cytotoxic T-cells and antibody-producing B-cells undergo apoptosis (i.e., they kill themselves).\nMemory\nMemory B and T-cells form - these survive into the long term and rapidly produce antibodies in the case of re-infection.\n\n\n1.2.2.1 Primary and Secondary Responses to an Infection\n\n\n\n\n\nAmount of Antibodies over Time\n\n\n\n\nThe first response is IgM-rich - because of this, it is relatively weak and non-specific.\nThe secondary response is IgG-rich - it is stronger and more specific.\n\n\n1.2.2.2 What are Cytokines?\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Cytokines in Various Scenarios\n\n\n\n\nCytokines are cell signalling molecules that are involved in the innate and adaptive immune systems."

    "text": "1.3 Parts of an Antibody\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Structure of an Antibody\n\n\n\n\nAn antibody is a protein that is comprised of antigen-binding and crystallizable fragments.\nThe antigen binding fragments (Fab) interact with antigens via variable heavy (i.e., VH) and variable light (i.e., VL) domains. Together, The VH and the VL form the antigen binding site.\nThe crystallizable fragment (Fc) perform effector functions - they help recruit NK and complimentary cells.\nThe hinge region allows the Fab and Fc regions to rotate and accommodate different interactions.\n\n1.3.1 Light and Heavy Chains\n\n\n\n\n\nLight and Heavy Chains of an Antibody\n\n\n\n\nLight chains have one constant and one variable domain.\nHeavy chains have one variable domain and three to four constant domains.\n\n\n1.3.2 Intermolecular and Intramolecular Disulfide Bonds\n\n\n\n\n\nBonds in an Antibody\n\n\n\n\nAntibodies are stabliized by inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds at the following locations:\n\nIntra-Domain Disulfide Bonds\nThere is one disulfide bond per domain - this contributes to domain stability and fold.\nCh1 - CL Disulfide Bonds\nThere is one of such bond per Fab. This bond stabilizes the heterodimer between heavy and light chains.\nHinge Region Disulfide Bonds\nThere are a variable number of these bonds (depending on the antibody in question).\nThese bonds stabilize IgG dimers.\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Antibody Isotypes\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Antibodies Found in the Human Body\n\n\n\n\nThe above table shows the various antibodies that are found in the human body.\nIgG antibodies are the preferred format for developing antibodies - these have a fast response time to pathogens, have a high affinity, and a long serum half-life.\nIgM antibodies are produced in the early phases of an immune reaction (to pathogens) - these antibodies have weak affinities (which are compensated by a pentameric format). However, they can recruit a complement system."
