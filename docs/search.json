    "text": "1.1 The Immune System\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Organs of the Human Immune System\n\n\n\n\nThe human body has numerous tissues and organs that are included in its immune system (i.e., a system that helps fend off pathogens):\n\nAdenoids\nThis is the first level of protection against pathogens in the nose.\nLymph Nodes\nThese enable B and T-cell activations\nBone Marrow\nThis is the site where blood is produced (i.e., haematopoiesis). B-cells also develop here via bone marrow-derived lymphocytes.\nTonsils\nThis is the first level of protection against pathogens in the mouth.\nThymus\nThis organ helps T-cells to mature.\nSpleen\nThis acts as a reserve of red blood cells (and also helps filter them). Microbes, opsonized pathogens, and aged or dead red blood cells are also filtered out here.\nB and T-cell activation also happens here.\nLymph Vessels\nImmune cells are circulated around the body via these.\n\n\n1.1.1 Innate and Adaptive Immunity\nThe innate immune system enables “non-self” antigens (e.g., pathogens) to be quickly eliminated. Cells in this system present antigens to activate T-cells (hence supporting antibody response).\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of Infection\n\n\n\n\nThe adaptive immune system has a slow response time (i.e., after the dashed vertical line above) and improves over time. Only via “memory” does this system quickly respond to known antigens.\n\n\n1.1.2 Main Cells of the Immune System\n\n\n\n\n\nCells of the Immune System\n\n\n\n\nThe immune system has many cells, of which include:\n\nMacrophages\nThese belong to the innate immune system and perform phagocytosis.\nThese are antigen-presenting cells.\nDendritic Cells\nThese also belong to the innate immune system and also play a role in phagocytosis, proteolysis, and the presentation of antigens.\nThese cells also play a role in T-cell activation.\nNatural Killer Cells\nThese belong to the innate immune system. They kill infected or cancer cells.\nT-Cells\nThese belong to the adaptive immune system; they are also specialized in recognizing non-self antigens via T-cell receptors.\nThere are numerous T-cells with different functions.\nB-Cells and Plasma Cells\nThese are part of the adaptive immune system and play a role in the production of antibodies.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 T-Cell Differentiation\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible T-Cells from Differentiation\n\n\n\n\nT-cells can differentiate into one of four kinds of T-cells:\n\nCD8+ “Cytotoxic” T-Cells\nThese kill cells that display a non-self antigen (e.g., an infected / tumor cell).\nCD4+ “Helper” T-Cells\nThese help activate CD8+ T-Cells and also B-Cells.\nCD4+ Regulatory Cells (Treg)\nThese help down-regulate the immune response.\nMemory T-Cells\nA small portion of T-cells go onto become involved in long-term immune responses.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 B-Cell Differentiation\n\n\n\n\n\nB-Cell Differentiation in the Human Immune System\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, B-cells can also go onto mature into one of several different kinds of B-cells:\n\nNaive B-Cells\nThese are B-cells that display antibodies against different kind of antigens’ surfaces (with about 107 to 108 different kinds of specific surfaces).\nActivated B-Cells\nThis happens when a naive B-cell binds to a specific antigen. This antigen (see above picture) is then displayed on its surface to help recruit CD4+ T-cells.\nPlasma B-Cells\nThese are antibody-producing cells.\nIgM - antibodies with a weak affinity and specificity - are produced and secreted. IgG - antibodies with a higher affinity and specificity - are generated in the long run.\nMemory B-Cells\nThese are involved in the long-term immune response to previously-encountered antigens.\n\nIgG-secreting antibodies can also be selected for further differentiation to produce higher-affinity IgGs via a maturation process."

Immunoglobins also recognize epitopes of various natures (e.g., proteins, lipids, sugars, etc).\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Phases of the Adaptive Immune System\n\n\n\n\n\nActivation of the Adaptive Immune System\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure goes in the following order:\n\nAntigen Recognition\nAntigen-presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells) show an antigen that is recognized by a naive T cell and / or a naive B-cell recognizes an antigen via an antibody on its surface.\nLymphocyte Activation\nThe specific T-cell is activated and undergoes clonal expansion. The T-cell then differentiates into effector T-cells.\nThe specific B-cell becomes activated, undergoes clonal expansion, and differentiates into antibody-producing cells.\nAntigen Elimination\nCytotoxic T-cells help eliminate infected cells.\nAntibodies also block pathogens and recruit innate immune cells (e.g., NK cells) to eliminate pathogens.\nContraction\nAfter pathogens are eliminated, cytotoxic T-cells and antibody-producing B-cells undergo apoptosis (i.e., they kill themselves).\nMemory\nMemory B and T-cells form - these survive into the long term and rapidly produce antibodies in the case of re-infection.\n\n\n1.2.2.1 Primary and Secondary Responses to an Infection\n\n\n\n\n\nAmount of Antibodies over Time\n\n\n\n\nThe first response is IgM-rich - because of this, it is relatively weak and non-specific.\nThe secondary response is IgG-rich - it is stronger and more specific.\n\n\n1.2.2.2 What are Cytokines?\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Cytokines in Various Scenarios\n\n\n\n\nCytokines are cell signalling molecules that are involved in the innate and adaptive immune systems."

Together, The VH and the VL form the antigen binding site.\nThe crystallizable fragment (Fc) perform effector functions - they help recruit NK and complimentary cells.\nThe hinge region allows the Fab and Fc regions to rotate and accommodate different interactions.\n\n1.3.1 Light and Heavy Chains\n\n\n\n\n\nLight and Heavy Chains of an Antibody\n\n\n\n\nLight chains have one constant and one variable domain.\nHeavy chains have one variable domain and three to four constant domains.\n\n\n1.3.2 Intermolecular and Intramolecular Disulfide Bonds\n\n\n\n\n\nBonds in an Antibody\n\n\n\n\nAntibodies are stabliized by inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds at the following locations:\n\nIntra-Domain Disulfide Bonds\nThere is one disulfide bond per domain - this contributes to domain stability and fold.\nCh1 - CL Disulfide Bonds\nThere is one of such bond per Fab. This bond stabilizes the heterodimer between heavy and light chains.\nHinge Region Disulfide Bonds\nThere are a variable number of these bonds (depending on the antibody in question).\nThese bonds stabilize IgG dimers.\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Antibody Isotypes\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious Antibodies Found in the Human Body\n\n\n\n\nThe above table shows the various antibodies that are found in the human body.\nIgG antibodies are the preferred format for developing antibodies - these have a fast response time to pathogens, have a high affinity, and a long serum half-life.\nIgM antibodies are produced in the early phases of an immune reaction (to pathogens) - these antibodies have weak affinities (which are compensated by a pentameric format). However, they can recruit a complement system."

    "section": "2.4 Steps to Designing a Therapeutic Antibody",
    "text": "2.4 Steps to Designing a Therapeutic Antibody\nThere are a total of five steps to designing such an antibody:\n\n2.4.1 Step #1: Understanding the Disease\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Example Diagram of a Localized Tumor\n\n\n\n\nAntibody therapies are generally based on a solid understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the illness being targeted - in this case, cancer.\nThe diagram above shows a tumor cell that is surrounded by an excess of ATP molecules (i.e., the pink circles) in vivo. These ATP molecules may promote further release of ATP, cell growth (i.e., uncontrolled mitosis), and also immune and inflammatory cell responses.\n\n\n2.4.2 Step #2: Identifying the Target Molecule and the Mode of Action\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Modes of Action of an Antibody\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the intended modes of action and / or the target regions of the target (i.e., the epitope) for the antibody in question, a different subclass of IgG antibodies might need to be used.\nRecall that IgG1 antibodies excel in targeting carbohydrates while IgG2 antibodies excel in targeting polysaccharides (e.g., sugar coatings).\n\n\n2.4.3 Step #3: Generating the Antigen Binding Fragments\nBS4019 lists two common methods of performing this step:\n\n2.4.3.1 Using Animals\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Mice as Model Organisms for Antibody Generation\n\n\n\n\nIn this procedure, an antigen is first injected into an animal (i.e., step 1). A serum (i.e., step 2) can then be extracted to yield a polyclonal antibody solution4.\nOnce antibody-producing B-cells can be extracted from the animal, these same B-cells are also fused with tumor cells to form hybridoma cells (i.e., step 4). These cells divide indefinitely and in doing so, produce antibodies.\nThese antibodies are then screened5 to filter out the correct antibody for mass production before they are clonally expanded to form monoclonal antibodies.\n\n2.4.3.1.1 An Alternative to Step 4\nBioinformatics may also be used to generate a suitable sequence to be fused with tumor cells’ genomes.\nThe VH and VL regions of the Fab fragment of the target antibody can then be amplified via in vivo methods (e.g., phage displays).\n\n\n\n2.4.3.2 Phage Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody Production Using Bacteriophages\n\n\n\n\nA library that contains about 1010 is first displayed at the surface of a bacteriophage before it is exposed to an antigen (which is typically the protein of interest that has been immobilized on a surface). In doing so, non-binding phages are washed away.\nThe binding phages then go on to infect E. coli cells - this process happens about two to six times. An ELISA assay is typically used after this to ensure binding. The phages may also be sequenced to identify Fab sequence.\n\n2.4.3.2.1 Alternative Steps\nInstead of developing a phage library, a yeast or mRNA display can be used instead.\nOtherwise, next-generation sequencing can also be used in step 4.\n\n\n\n2.4.3.3 Step #4: Selecting an Appropriate IgG Subclass\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Uses and Side Effects of Different IgG Antibody Subclasses\n\n\n\n\nRecall that IgG3 antibodies are generally never used in therapeutic antibody production due to its unfavorable diamond configuration.\nHowever, both IgG1 and IgG2 / IgG4 antibodies can be used with the following side effects for:\n\nBlocking Activity\nIgG2 / IgG4 antibodies can be used to accomplish this without destroying the cell.\nIgG1 antibodies can be used too, but they cause cell death.\nCell Activation\nIgG2 / (engineered) IgG4 antibodies can be used to do this without killing the cell.\nIgG1 antibodies can be used for this purpose too, albeit they kill the cell.\nRecruiting NK Cells\nIgG1 antibodies can be used for this.\nEngineered IgG1 antibodies can lead to enhanced ADCCs.\nRecruiting Monocytes\nIgG1 antibodies are used for this.\nEngineered IgG1 antibodies can lead to enhanced opsonisation6.\nRecruiting Complements\nNormal CDCs can help recruit IgG1 antibodies.\nLikewise, enhancing CDCs can help recruit enhanced IgG1 antibodies.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Step #5: Humanizing Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunogenicity Risk of Antibody by Humanization Status\n\n\n\n\nHumanizing antibodies decreases the risk of immunogenicity: the event that the body’s immune system attacks a non-self molecule.\nChimeric antibodies are antibodies whose VH and VL regions from mice antibodies have been grafted onto a human antibody’s Fab fragment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Examples of Therapeutic Antibodies\n\n\n\n\nIn a humanized antibody, parts of the Fab’s CDR have been grafted on from mouse antibodies.\nSome examples of FDA-approved antibodies are shown in the above table. Depending on the suffix of the antibody’s name, one can guess the origin of the antibody - most notably:\n\n“-lumab” refers to a human antibody.\n“-umab” refers to a mouse antibody.\n“-ximab” refers to a chimeric antibody.\n\n\n\n2.4.5 Step #6: Validating Molecules\nSee the following chapter for more information!"

Asial’s PhD during his 2013 stint with NTU.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple Behind SPR\n\n\n\n\nThe general idea behind this validation method is that analyte binding changes the angle of reflected light.\nWhen an analyte is introduced, it passes through a blank flow cell and becomes immobilized on a chip that contains an antigen. A thin layer of gold opposite the aforementioned chip is excited by polarized light from a prism - this reflected light is captured on a detector.\nWhen the antigen and antibody binds, there is an increase in mass and also a change in refractive angle (i.e., Figure B). The binding eventually reaches saturation - the maximum refractive angle - before it returns back to the original baseline.\n\n\n3.4.3 Biolayer Interferometry (i.e., BLI)\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematics of a BLI\n\n\n\n\nThis method measures the change in light wavelength due to thickness changes at the end of a fibre optic tip.\n\n\n\n\n\nBLI Data During Experimentation\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph shows what data collected during a BLI may appear as to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding Affinity Graph\n\n\n\n\nBoth SPR and BLI measure binding affinity. The following terms are used:\n\n\\(k_a\\) is the association constant measured in M-1s-1\n\\(k_d\\) is the disassociation constant measured in s-1\n\\(K_d\\) is the equilibrium disassociation constant in M. Note that \\(\\displaystyle K_d = \\frac{k_d}{k_a}\\).\n\nFor antibodies, a fast \\(k_\\text{on}\\) and a slow \\(k_\\text{off}\\) is preferred.\n\\(k_D\\) should be less than 10 nM in the Fab format while \\(k_D\\) should be less than 5 nM in the IgG format.\n\n\n3.4.4 Flow Cytometry\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram Illustrating Flow Cytometry\n\n\n\n\nThere are a handful of steps:\n\nAntibodies are labelled using fluorescence and put in contact with target cells.\nCells flow through the laser one at a time.\nLight scattering detectors help determine particle size to identify different cell types.\nFluorescence detectors detect antibodies found in cells.\nIn some settings, cells can be sorted to fluorescence.\nThe data is analyzed using software."

    "text": "4.2 Case Study on Rituximab\nLymphoma is a cancer of the lymphocytes (i.e., B and / or T-cells).\n\n\n\n\n\nA Stained Reed-Sternberg Cell on Display\n\n\n\n\nIn Hodgkin lymphoma patients, patients exhibit Reed-Sternberg cells (i.e., giant lymphocytes).\nLymphoma cases represent 2.8% of all cancer cases (about 510000 cases) worldwide and 2.6% of all cancer-related fatalities (about 250000 deaths) worldwide.\nIn Singapore, lymphoma represents 4.7% of all cancer cases (about 1099 cases) and about 3% of all cancer-related fatalities (about 361 deaths). It is also the 5th most common cancer among males.\n\n4.2.1 Possible Mechanisms and Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of B Cell Maturation\n\n\n\n\nWhen B-cells mature, they begin expressing a protein called Cluster of Differentiation 20 (i.e., CD20). Newly-formed B-cells do not express this protein.\nHence, a potential therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma could be to deplete B-cell numbers via targeting with monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n4.2.2 Rituximab’s Mode of Action\n\n\n\n\n\nRituximab’s Mode of Action\n\n\n\n\nWhen Rituximab binds to a B-cell (i.e., opsonization), the tagged B-cell can be eliminated on one of three ways:\n\nComplement Activation Cascade\nThis was covered during week 2. The cascade eventually results in the recruitment of protein called the membrane attachment complex (i.e., MAC). This protein causes lysis and elimination via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (i.e., ADCC).\nAntibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (i.e., ADCP)\nThe crystallizable fragments of Rituximab can also recruit macrophages to the site of infection for phagocytosis.\nNK Cell Recruitment\nThe antibody can also recruit NK cells to the site of infection via Fc\\(\\gamma\\)RIII receptors.\n\n\n\n4.2.3 CD20 Target\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic of the CD20 Protein\n\n\n\n\nCD20 is an integral protein that is exclusively expressed by B-cells. It has four trans-membrane alpha helices and two extracellular loops (where Rituximab binds).\nCD20 is thought to be involved in B-cell differentiation, if not also function as an ion channel (though this yet to be confirmed).\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of CD20\n\n\n\n\nVia cryo-electron microscopy, it is confirmed that CD20 is a dimer tha binds two Rituximab antigen binding fragments (Rituximab mainly binds to the ECL2 region of CD20).\n\n\n4.2.4 Antibody Discovery, Expression, and Purification\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding Affinity Graphs of Rituximab\n\n\n\n\nRituximab is identified by hybridoma cells and cloned into mammalian expression vectors. The antibody is expressed in CHO cells and purified via protein A chromatography.\nIn another source, the authors claim that the antigen-binding fragments of Rituximab can also be produced in bacterial perplasm; antibodies (i.e., the IgG variety) are produced in HEK293 cells before they are secreted into extracellular media. The authors used protein G chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography."

    "text": "5.1 Patenting Antibodies\nPatents exist for the following reasons:\n\nTo enjoy exclusive rights for use and commercialization\nTo fend off competition\nTo generate product revenue via licensing or selling (either to consumers or stakeholders).\n\nHowever, in the antibody field, patents can usually be awarded for one of four main categories:\n\nNovel antibodies\nThese refer to antibodies with new sequences or antibodies that target new epitopes.\nNovel therapeutic antibodies\nThis refers to the use of an antibody to treat a specific disease.\nAntibody modifications\nFor instance, stabilizing mutations.\nMethodologies\nThis may involve new screening technologies, new production methods, new diagnostic tools, and so on.\n\nDepending on where the product is made, a patent attorney made need to be approached in the private sector. In academic settings like NTU, the university’s patent office should be engaged1.\nPatents are generally sought prior to disclosing one’s invention publicly\n\n5.1.1 Characteristics of Patents\n\nPatents are defined by claims\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Example Patent Claims\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic provides some examples.\nThey have a priority and a due date\nThe due date is typically 20 years past the priority date.\nThey provide monopoly rights to an invention\nThey prohibit others from performing certain acts without the stakeholders’ permission\n\n\n\n\n\nPfizer Being Sued Over Patent Infringements\n\n\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is crowded with patents. If an infringement occurs, the patent holder can take legal actions.\nPatent attorneys can help avoid such surprises by doing a freedom-to-operate search and analysis.\nThey are limited to the territory that they are granted in\n\nIf a patent prohibits one from commercializing their discoveries, they can:\n\nTry to find a way around the patent\nFor instance, use an alternative method.\nPay to use the patent\nFor instance, pay for a license.\nStrike a deal\nThey can establish a partnership with the company that holds the patent.\nChallenge the patent\nIf one of the patent’s claims has limited foundation, one can also try to invalidate them.\n\nWhatever the case, always consult the patent attorney first!\n\n\n5.1.2 Patenting Timeline and Costs\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of Acquiring a Patent and the Costs of One"

A drug of average efficacy can capture 92% of a best-in-class drug’s value just by being in first class.\nIf it not possible to arrive first, then the best-in-class drug should arrive no later than two years to capture its potential. After two to five years, a best-in-class drug would have lost over 40% of its maximum potential value."
