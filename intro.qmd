# Introduction to Antibodies

This chapter covers rudimentary information on antibodies, including but not limited to the kinds found in the human body, their response to pathogens, their interactions, and their structure.

## The Immune System

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Various Organs of the Human Immune System", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/antibodies.jpg")
```

The human body has numerous tissues and organs that are included in its immune system (i.e., a system that helps fend off pathogens):

1.  **Adenoids**

    This is the first level of protection against pathogens in the nose.
    
1.  **Lymph Nodes**

    These enable B and T-cell activations
    
1.  **Bone Marrow**

    This is the site where blood is produced (i.e., haematopoiesis).  B-cells also develop here via bone marrow-derived lymphocytes.
    
1.  **Tonsils**

    This is the first level of protection against pathogens in the mouth.
    
1.  **Thymus**

    This organ helps T-cells to mature.
    
1.  **Spleen**

    This acts as a reserve of red blood cells (and also helps filter them).  Microbes, opsonized pathogens, and aged or dead red blood cells are also filtered out here.
    
    B and T-cell activation also happens here.
    
1.  **Lymph Vessels**

    Immune cells are circulated around the body via these.

### Innate and Adaptive Immunity

The **innate** immune system enables "non-self" antigens (e.g., pathogens) to be quickly eliminated.  Cells in this system present antigens to activate T-cells (hence supporting antibody response).

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Timeline of Infection", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/mic.jpg")
```

The **adaptive** immune system has a slow response time (i.e., after the dashed vertical line above) and improves over time.  Only via "memory" does this system quickly respond to known antigens.

### Main Cells of the Immune System

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Cells of the Immune System", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/maincells.jpg")
```

The immune system has many cells, of which include:

1.  **Macrophages**

    These belong to the *innate* immune system and perform phagocytosis.  
    
    These are antigen-presenting cells.
    
1.  **Dendritic Cells**

    These also belong to the *innate* immune system and also play a role in phagocytosis, proteolysis, and the presentation of antigens.
    
    These cells also play a role in T-cell activation.
    
1.  **Natural Killer Cells**

    These belong to the *innate* immune system.  They kill infected or cancer cells.
    
1.  **T-Cells**

    These belong to the *adaptive* immune system; they are also specialized in recognizing non-self antigens via T-cell receptors.
    
    There are numerous T-cells with different functions.
    
1.  **B-Cells and Plasma Cells**

    These are part of the *adaptive* immune system and play a role in the production of antibodies.
    
### T-Cell Differentiation

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Possible T-Cells from Differentiation", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/tdiff.jpg")
```

T-cells can differentiate into one of four kinds of T-cells:

1.  **CD8+ "Cytotoxic" T-Cells**

    These kill cells that display a non-self antigen (e.g., an infected / tumor cell).
    
1.  **CD4+ "Helper" T-Cells**

    These help activate CD8+ T-Cells and also B-Cells.
    
1.  **CD4+ Regulatory Cells (Treg)**

    These help down-regulate the immune response.

1.  **Memory T-Cells**

    A small portion of T-cells go onto become involved in long-term immune responses.
    
### B-Cell Differentiation

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "B-Cell Differentiation in the Human Immune System", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/bdiff.jpg")
```

Similarly, B-cells can also go onto mature into one of several different kinds of B-cells:

1.  **Naive B-Cells**

    These are B-cells that display antibodies against different kind of antigens' surfaces (with about 10^7^ to 10^8^ different kinds of specific surfaces).

1.  **Activated B-Cells**

    This happens when a naive B-cell binds to a specific antigen.  This antigen (see above picture) is then displayed on its surface to help recruit CD4+ T-cells.

1.  **Plasma B-Cells**

    These are antibody-producing cells.
    
    **IgM** - antibodies with a weak affinity and specificity - are produced and secreted.  **IgG** - antibodies with a higher affinity and specificity - are generated in the long run.
    
1.  **Memory B-Cells**

    These are involved in the long-term immune response to previously-encountered antigens.
    
IgG-secreting antibodies can also be selected for further differentiation to produce higher-affinity IgGs via a maturation process.

## Immune System Responses

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Structures Involved in Innate and Adaptive Immunity", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/proteins.jpg")
```

The human body's innate immune system relies on patterns that are associated with pathogens and cell damage.

The adaptive immune system relies on specialized molecules with high specificities: **T**-**c**ell **r**eceptors (i.e, **TCR**s) and antibodies.

### Antigen-Recognizing Molecules of the Immune System

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Some Antigen-Recognizing Molecules", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/molecules.jpg")
```

BS4019 covers a few:

1.  **MHC molecules**

    These molecules shows linear peptides on antigen-presenting, infected, or cancerous cells.
    
1.  **T-Cell Receptors**

    These are receptors that are displayed by T-cells.
    
    These receptors also help recognize linear peptides that are shown by MHC molecules.
    
1.  **Immunoglobins (i.e., Ig / antibodies)**

    These are secreted by $\beta$-cells.  Immunoglobins also recognize epitopes of various natures (e.g., proteins, lipids, sugars, etc).

### Phases of the Adaptive Immune System

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Activation of the Adaptive Immune System", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/activation.jpg")
```

The above figure goes in the following order:

1.  **Antigen Recognition**

    Antigen-presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells) show an antigen that is recognized by a naive T cell and / or a naive B-cell recognizes an antigen via an antibody on its surface.
    
1.  **Lymphocyte Activation**

    The specific T-cell is activated and undergoes clonal expansion.  The T-cell then differentiates into effector T-cells.
    
    The specific B-cell becomes activated, undergoes clonal expansion, and differentiates into antibody-producing cells.
    
1.  **Antigen Elimination**

    Cytotoxic T-cells help eliminate infected cells.
    
    Antibodies also block pathogens and recruit innate immune cells (e.g., NK cells) to eliminate pathogens.
    
1.  **Contraction**

    After pathogens are eliminated, cytotoxic T-cells and antibody-producing B-cells undergo apoptosis (i.e., they kill themselves).
    
1.  **Memory**

    Memory B and T-cells form - these survive into the long term and rapidly produce antibodies in the case of re-infection.
    
#### Primary and Secondary Responses to an Infection 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Amount of Antibodies over Time", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/response.jpg")
```

The first response is IgM-rich - because of this, it is relatively weak and non-specific.

The secondary response is IgG-rich - it is stronger and more specific.


#### What are Cytokines?

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Examples of Cytokines in Various Scenarios", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/cytokine.jpg")
```

**Cytokines** are cell signalling molecules that are involved in the innate and adaptive immune systems.

## Parts of an Antibody

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Basic Structure of an Antibody", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/antibody.jpg")
```

An **antibody** is a protein that is comprised of antigen-binding and crystallizable fragments.

The **antigen binding fragments (Fab)** interact with antigens via **v**ariable **h**eavy (i.e., **VH**) and **v**ariable **l**ight (i.e., **VL**) domains.  Together, The VH and the VL form the antigen binding site.

The **crystallizable fragment (Fc)** perform effector functions - they help recruit NK and complimentary cells.

The **hinge region** allows the Fab and Fc regions to rotate and accommodate different interactions.

### Light and Heavy Chains

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Light and Heavy Chains of an Antibody", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/light.jpg")
```

**Light chains** have one constant and one variable domain.

**Heavy chains** have one variable domain and three to four constant domains.

### Intermolecular and Intramolecular Disulfide Bonds

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Bonds in an Antibody", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/bonds.jpg")
```

Antibodies are stabliized by inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds at the following locations:

1.  **Intra-Domain Disulfide Bonds**

    There is one disulfide bond per domain - this contributes to domain stability and fold.
    
1.  **Ch1 - CL Disulfide Bonds**

    There is one of such bond per Fab.  This bond stabilizes the heterodimer between heavy and light chains.
    
1.  **Hinge Region Disulfide Bonds**

    There are a variable number of these bonds (depending on the antibody in question).  
    
    These bonds stabilize IgG dimers.
    
### Antibody Isotypes

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Various Antibodies Found in the Human Body", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/isotypes.jpg")
```

The above table shows the various antibodies that are found in the human body.

IgG antibodies are the preferred format for developing antibodies - these have a fast response time to pathogens, have a high affinity, and a long serum half-life.

IgM antibodies are produced in the early phases of an immune reaction (to pathogens) - these antibodies have weak affinities (which are compensated by a pentameric format).  However, they can recruit a complement system.

## Antibody-Antigen Interactions

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Structure of Antibody Labelled", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/epi.jpg")
```

BS4019 uses the following terms:

1.  **Antigen**

    This is a specific molecule that is targeted by an antibody.
    
1.  **Epitope**

    This is the specific sequence or surface of an antigen that is targeted by an antibody.
    
1.  **Paratope**

    This is the specific sequence or surface of the *antibody* that interacts with the antigen.
    
1.  **Fab**

    These are made out of heavy *and* light chains.
    
###  Complimentary Determining Regions (i.e., CRDs)

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "CRDs in an Antibody", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk1/vhvhl.jpg")
```

All VH and VL domains carry three CDRs each - each of these CDRs also vary in sequence composition and length.

The CDRs are hypervariable regions that provide specificity.
