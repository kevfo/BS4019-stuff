# Case Study: Rituximab

In this week's lecture, prof. Asial runs through some common tips for searching for information on the web.  He also illustrates his findings (as an example) on the FDA-approved antibody Rituximab.

```

Prof. Asial also recommends [the above reading](https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z) for those who want to know more about therapeutic antibodies and their use in diseases.

## Potential Sources and Trail Following

Prof. Asial lists some sources:

1.  **Nature Reviews**

    ```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Nature Reviews' Search Engine", fig.align = "center"}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/nature.jpg")
    ```
    
    Nature Reviews provides rigorous review articles on scientific topics.
    
1.  **Google Images**

    ```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Using Google Images to Search for Mechanisms of Action", fig.align = "center"}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/gimage.jpg")    
    ```
    
    Google Images is a nice starting place when trying to look for graphics to explain an antibody's mode of action.
    
1.  **PubMed**

    ```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "PubMed's Search Engine", fig.align = "center"}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/pubmed.jpg")    
    ```
    
    PubMed is also a nice starting point to search for information.

1.  **Google Scholar**

    ```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Google Scholar's Search Engine", fig.align = "center"}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/scholar.jpg")    
    ```
    
    This is a very common search engine used to search for scholarly information, yet is also a good starting point.
    
### Reading Articles 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "References in Articles", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/ref.jpg")
```

Often times in papers, author(s) may reference one or more papers.  In some cases, following the reference trail may be handy in helping to find information about the antibody.

```{r echo = F, fig.cao = "Original Name of Rituximab", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/original.jpg")
```

Antibodies may also have different names - as is the case with Rituximab.  

## Case Study on Rituximab 

**Lymphoma** is a cancer of the lymphocytes (i.e., B and / or T-cells).  

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "A Stained Reed-Sternberg Cell on Display", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/reed.jpg")
```

In **Hodgkin lymphoma** patients, patients exhibit Reed-Sternberg cells (i.e., giant lymphocytes).

Lymphoma cases represent 2.8% of all cancer cases (about 510000 cases) worldwide and 2.6% of all cancer-related fatalities (about 250000 deaths) worldwide.

In Singapore, lymphoma represents 4.7% of all cancer cases (about 1099 cases) and about 3% of all cancer-related fatalities (about 361 deaths).  It is also the 5^th^ most common cancer among males.

### Possible Mechanisms and Treatment

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Illustration of B Cell Maturation", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/bcell.jpg")
```

When B-cells mature, they begin expressing a protein called **C**luster of **D**ifferentiation **20** (i.e., **CD20**).  Newly-formed B-cells do not express this protein.

Hence, a potential therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma could be to deplete B-cell numbers via targeting with monoclonal antibodies.

### Rituximab's Mode of Action

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Rituximab's Mode of Action", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/action.jpg")
```

When Rituximab binds to a B-cell (i.e., opsonization), the tagged B-cell can be eliminated on one of three ways:

1.  **Complement Activation Cascade**

    This was covered during week 2.  The cascade eventually results in the recruitment of protein called the **m**embrane **a**ttachment **c**omplex (i.e., **MAC**).  This protein causes lysis and elimination via **a**ntibody-**d**ependent **c**ellular **c**ytotoxicity (i.e., **ADCC**).
    
1.  **Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (i.e., ADCP)**

    The crystallizable fragments of Rituximab can also recruit macrophages to the site of infection for phagocytosis.
    
1.  **NK Cell Recruitment**

    The antibody can also recruit NK cells to the site of infection via Fc$\gamma$RIII receptors.
    
### CD20 Target

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Schematic of the CD20 Protein", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/cd20.jpg")
```

**CD20** is an integral protein that is exclusively expressed by B-cells.  It has four trans-membrane alpha helices and two extracellular loops (where Rituximab binds). 

CD20 is thought to be involved in B-cell differentiation, if not also function as an ion channel (though this yet to be confirmed).

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Structure of CD20", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/ri.jpg")
```

Via cryo-electron microscopy, it is confirmed that CD20 is a dimer tha binds two Rituximab antigen binding fragments (Rituximab mainly binds to the ECL2 region of CD20).

### Antibody Discovery, Expression, and Purification

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Binding Affinity Graphs of Rituximab", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk5/bindingAfff.jpg")
```

Rituximab is identified by hybridoma cells and cloned into mammalian expression vectors.  The antibody is expressed in CHO cells and purified via protein A chromatography.

In another source, the authors claim that the antigen-binding fragments of Rituximab can also be produced in bacterial perplasm; antibodies (i.e., the IgG variety) are produced in HEK293 cells before they are secreted into extracellular media.  The authors used protein G chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography.
