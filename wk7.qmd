# Regulatory Investigational New Drug Application

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Timeline of Clinical Development of a New Drug", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/timeline.jpg")
```

The above figure shows the general timeline (covered in the previous lecture) for developing a novel drug. The entire timeline takes about 12 years.

## Pharmacokenetics versus Pharmacodynamics

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Differences Between Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/pp.jpg")
```

The above figure illustrates the differences between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. **Pharmacokinetics** deals with the administration of a drug while **pharmacodynamics** deals with the effects of a drug.

### Pharmacokinetics

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Elimination of a Drug from the Body", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/half.jpg")
```

Drugs are eliminated from the human body over time. The **half time** (i.e., $\displaystyle t_\frac{1}{2}$) of a drug is the amount of time that is needed to clear 50% of it from the body.

#### Biodistributions

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Biodistribution Schematic", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/biodist.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Biodistribution Schematic in Mice", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/mice.jpg")
```

In a typical biodistribution setup, the drug is administered (either using single or multiple concentrations) and measured in different organs at different time points.

Drug concentrations can be detected using fluorescence labeling and radioisotope labeling.

### Pharmacodynamics

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Potency and Effectiveness", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/mice.jpg")
```

The **potency** of a drug is its required dose to generate an effect. A drug's **effectiveness** is its intensity of its effects or its response.

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Example of Rituximab Biodistribution", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/rituxdist.jpg")
```

The above figure shows an example of a biodistribution assay.  The vertical axis represents the percentage of injected dose per gram; the bars represent time post injection.

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Dose Response Curve of Two Drugs", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/rituxdist.jpg")
```

The above dose-response curve shows the behavior of two hypothetical drugs *in vitro*.  Drug A is more potent while drug B is more effective.

## Efficacy Studies and Toxicology

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Overview of IND (i.e., International New Drug)", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/all.jpg")
```

### Efficacy Studies

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Several Xenograft Models in Mice", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/mouse.jpg")
```

#### Example: Anti-PDL1 mAb MEDI4736

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Antitumor Activity in Mice Injected with MEDI4736", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/micedata.jpg")
```

In this study, mABs were injected into mice twice per week; the tumor volume of the mice's tumors were observed for 25 days.

### Toxicology 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Duration of Clinical Trials Depending on Model Organism", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/organisms.jpg")
```

Toxicology studies typically happen in two mammalian species.  Mice and rats are the choice organism for rodents while non-human primates (e.g., monkeys) are the choice organism for non-rodents.

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Illustration of LD~50~ and ED~50~", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/ti.jpg")
```

The **ED~50~** is the **E**ffective **D**ose for a drug to have some effect on 50% of an organism's population.  The **LD~50~** is the lethal dose for 50% of the population (i.e., the amount needed to kill off 50% of the population).

The **Therapeutic Index** is the quotient of the LD~50~ and the ED~50~ - in other words, $\displaystyle \frac{LD_{50}}{ED_{50}}$.  The standard safety margin is: $\displaystyle \frac{LD_1 - ED_{99}}{ED_{99}} \times 100$.

## Manufacturing 

### Cell Line Development

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Cell Line Development", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/production.jpg")
```

### Process Development 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Process Development", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/process.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Upstream Process Optimizations", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/upstream.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Downstream Process Optimizations", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/downstream.jpg")
```

### Stability Testing

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk7/stability.jpg")
```

IND submissions can be started 1 - 3 months after stability testing.
