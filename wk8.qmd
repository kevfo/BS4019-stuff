# Clinical Trials for Antibody Therapies

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Major Drug Regulatory Companies", fig.align = "center"}

```

According to the US' **N**ational **I**nstitute of **H**ealth (i.e., **NIH**), the main ethical requirements for any study are:

1.  Social value
1.  Scientific validity
1.  Fair subject selection
1.  Consent
1.  Favorable risk to benefit ratio
1.  Independent review
1.  Respect for human subjects

A thorough review will also be performed by the major regulatory agencies in the above figure (depending on where one is).

## Phase I Studies 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Objectives of a Phase I Study", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/phasei.jpg")
```

The above figure lists some important ideas to note as they pertain to phase I studies.

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Grades of Adverse Events and their Meanings", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/aes.jpg")
```

The above figure lists five different grades of **a**dverse **e**ffects (i.e., **AE**s).  

### Examples 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Mechanism of Blinatumomab", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/bli.jpg")
```

Blinatumomab is an antibody that binds to CD3 and CD19 proteins.

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Adverse Effects Pertaining to Blinatumomab", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/ex1.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Adverse Effects Pertaining to Blinatumomab", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/ex2.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Adverse Effects Pertaining to Blinatumomab", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/ex3.jpg")
```

The above figure lists some adverse effects as they pertain to Blinatumomab.

## Phase II Studies 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Objectives of Phase II Studies", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/pii.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Terms Used in Phase II Studies", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/pii.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "More Terms Used in Phase II Studies", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/pii.jpg")
```

The above graphics list some terms used in phase II studies and the overall objectives of a phase II study.

### Examples of Safety and Study Techniques in Phase II

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Phase II Safety", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/psiistudy.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Phase II Study Design", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/psiisafety.jpg")
```

The abvoe graphics show some design and safety considerations when it comes to study design in phase II studies.

## Phase II Studies 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Objectives of Phase III Studies", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/psiii.jpg")
```

### Hazard Ratios

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Meanings of Hazard Ratio Values", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/hrmeaning.jpg")
```

A **hazard ratio** (i.e., **HR**) is the proportion of those in the treatment group who have an AE to those in the control who have an AE.

The above graphic also illustrates what different hazard ratios mean.
