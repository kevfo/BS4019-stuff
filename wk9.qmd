# FDA Approval and Post-Market Surveillance 

This lecture focuses on the following contents:

1.  Post-market surveillance (i.e., phase IV)
1.  Pricing 
1.  Life cycle of drugs and biosimilars 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Major Drug Regulatory Agencies in Nations", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk9/majorDrug.jpg")
```

The above figure lists some major drug regulatory agencies in various nations (including Singapore).  Also recall that it takes about 12 years for a drug to go from its discovery to market authorization.

## Objectives of Postmarketing Surveillance Trials 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Objectives of Phase IV Trials", fig.align = "center"}

```

The above figure lists some objectives in of postmarket surveillance.

### Sales

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Sales in the Monoclonal Antibody Market", fig.align = "center"}

```

Prices for monoclonal antibodies are also influenced by numerous factors:

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Factors that Influence Price Sensitivity in the mAB Market", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk9/factors.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Pricing Rates for Monoclonal Antibodies in the USA", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk9/usaPricing.jpg")
```

The above figure shows average pricing rates for monoclonal antibodies depending on the kind of treatment that the mAB in question is used for.

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Factors that Influence Purchasing", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk9/purchaseFactors.jpg")
```

There are also several layers that influence the sale of a monoclonal antibody.

## Lifecycle of Drugs

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Lifecycle of a Drug in Profits", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk9/lifecycle.jpg")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Comparisons of Costs and Focuses Between Biologics and Biosimilars", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk9/dev.jpg")
```
